@burhankunda_,"I just watch your this video, i really liked your videos. I also live in Oakville and my advise is dont sell your house. There is a big possibility interest rate going to decrease this year and 1 percent for sure in 2024. So first option is stay here . Option 2 : Rent out oakville and you urself go on rent somwhere else. The benefit is you will keep your house in oakville which will have an excellent price gain while you go to waterloo  on rent and whatever rent you get from oakville house you can get half of rent in two bedroom appartment for only 3 years until rate down and prices up and then you come back. 
Never ever sell your oakville house if you do thsi you will never ever able to buy this. This house is a ticket in long term so use this house as investment property and you urself go on rent

Thank you

In Jan there was no snow with grass visible and I was wearing half sweater outside as it was warm due to chinook. Also +5 of Toronto will be same as -5 to -10 of Calgary due to dry weather ( less moisture). Calgary is under rated if you ask me. 
We moved from Montreal last year to Calgary and it was the best decision ( if you have a job here). Job opportunities are less but people are also less and IT scene has grown over the past 2-3 years with big names like Accenture and some fintech companies as well.

@wojciechbogucki7099,"The first thing is being on a variable rate specially this time it is just crazy unless you ahve not overshooted with your mortgage payments in terms how bug they are compared to your income. As of now you can get a fixed rate for about 4.8% which I think it is good. You can try to refinance your mortgage with another bank like CIBC and get it fixed for 5 years. Also it is good to make some once off payments during the year to reduce the interest overpayment etc. Alberta is nice, in terms of jobs it is also good. We are in New Brunswick at the moment and a lot of people are moving to this province. You might consider this as well. This is why when you take your mortgage you have to also take into consideration things that might happen in the future including broken economy etc. A lot of people are maxing out on their mortgages and they can barely afforded once things will go bad :(",2023-06-04T21:29:24Z,POSITIVE

@Youngblood22336,"Last year, I stayed 3 months in Delhi, 2 months in Calgary and I live full time in Toronto. Truth is, best quality of life is in India and it is getting better. The quality of immigration in Canada is getting worse and things are going to get much worse before they get better. The BOC and the US Fed want to increase unemployment first and then cut interest rates sometime in 2024. So, to rank 1) Delhi 2) Toronto 3) Calgary - cheap houses, but it's ideal when you are 45 years old and just want to chill with family. Apart from the house, everything else is more expensive- food, insurance, weather, parking etc.. Delhi and Toronto have much better job opportunities and frankly Delhi just has more quality competition. So I would suggest to probably find a nice rental place (and sell home) or go through the high inflation storm of 2 years in Toronto. Canada will follow the US on rates, and the US will use a hop on policy i.e. rate increase every second meeting going forward (june- no hike, next meeting increase due to new employment and inflation numbers)",2023-06-03T17:31:59Z,NEUTRAL

@rmegha77,"Hey! On a friendly note, you might be an amazing person but I seriously think you gotta get more exposure to people who have real money troubles, like real living from paycheque to paycheque situation. There is Ikea and there is CB2, you buy a $600 pendant lamp from CB2 and a person living from PC to PC would probably get half of all their furniture at that price( from Ikea or secondhand or maybe free porch pickup even), they also want to buy that lamp from the expensive store but they simply can't. I am no one to judge you but this really gives me the vibe of ""Ananya Pandey's struggle"". If you wanna buy all the expensive stuff that's cool, that's your lifestyle but then you cannot complain about savings. If I have limited income and my lifestyle is such that I will only stay in Fairmont(just an example) and then if I complain to my friends that I am not saving anything, they would probably laugh at me. See I love you, this is not coming from a place of hate but I just think you gotta widen your exposure, that will keep you grounded. Rest, I live in Calgary, this is an amazing city, there are enough events all around the year, you can go to the mountains anytime and winter is not as bad as people think it is, I have lived in Ontario for a year and now in Calgary and I honestly find winters much better here cz it is sunny all the time, chinooks help a lot and I can ski as much as I want.",2023-06-01T17:54:35Z,POSITIVE

Your amortization might have extended like anything with nothing much going into principal. Also, consider selling your house (the spring market had a dead cat bounce and was a good opportunity to sell). Canada is overdebted and money is concentrated only on one asset class (real estate) and no investment in the real economy. Wages have stagnated and quality of life is degrading quickly.

@Avian1397,"Interest rate issue is a global problem. When you applied for mortgage you showed your income from the full-time job you once had but weren‚Äôt planning to pursue that in the future, which means your affordability wasn‚Äôt as high as you had during your application. Then you went on to make a series of financial decisions like upgrading kitchen which actually was functional but wasn‚Äôt aesthetically pleasing for you, a new car whereas a used one could have done the job, new furniture like a bed whereas your old ikea bed could have been used for a little longer, Peleton bike during spring where you could have just chosen to go for a run, etc.

The focus of this comment is not to point out the faults but to try and make you understand that the problem was self created in a way. 

Undoing so much of damage is complicated and entirely depends on the contracts you have for each of the debt you chose to get yourself into.

Inflation is coming under control in most of the countries so the interest rates might have just reached its peak. You could consider to wait it off as the cost involved in moving is a lot higher than paying interest on this property.",2023-05-30T08:28:28Z,NEGATIVE

@JOHNMARK-vr5qz,"Hey, I moved from living in Toronto's core downtown for years to Calgary. And for me, it was the best decision ever. 
1. Winters - Yes, people think winters are crazy in Calgary.. but honestly, it's not. Calgary is dry, so the winters are a lot more bearable(Comparison: -15 in Toronto is comparable to -25 in Calgary). 
2. Love the sun: It's super sunny. 300 days of the sun makes winters enjoyable and fun (super sunny winners, not gloomy). And don't forget the chinooks; for every 1 week of -20, there would be 3 to 4 for +5. 
3. Things to do in Calgary - There are very few downtown things to do in Calgary (Especially if you compare to Toronto) But tons and tons of outdoorsy things to do (If you don't like outdoor stuff, that's a different story). 
4. Friendlier people - People are more helpful and friendlier here than in Toronto. Strangers would stop, take time and chat with you. Your neighbors know you and look out for you. 
5. Cost of living -  Lower tax (5% vs. 13%), Cheaper housing, and Food prices at restaurants might be the same, but the portion is huge (But this is subjective). 
6. Jobs - Yes, moving with a job is advisable. There are definitely fewer opportunities as compared to Toronto. But it depends on which sector. and things are improving. BTW, oil and gas also have IT openings. 
7. Pace of life - It's peaceful; some people like it, others hate it. But it depends on what you value more. 
Note: If you are thinking about Calgary only because it's cheap, you might eventually regret your decision. Think about what you enjoy and value more. All the best",2023-05-29T16:48:24Z,POSITIVE

@easyveganfoodie,"My husband and I moved to Ottawa after two years in Toronto. We bought our house maybe a few months after you. Luckily we decided not to buy at the top of our budget so even though the interest rates has really hit us badly, it‚Äôs not so bad that we have to consider moving. 

We really like Ottawa, I‚Äôve seen your Ottawa blog so I think you liked it too! It‚Äôs a good option if you want to move out of GTA. Also, we bought our house at the peak of the market and it‚Äôs really gone down now. We bought a end unit townhouse for the price that detached homes are selling for now! So if you do consider moving to Ottawa, you can probably get a house your size for a much lower price than what you paid (because prices have gone down and also because it‚Äôs Ottawa not GTA). The winters here are comparable to Toronto. Of course it‚Äôs colder but not by much.  

Another option if you don‚Äôt want to move and wait for the interest rates to go down is to rent out a room or just start budgeting (I know you don‚Äôt want to make big sacrifices but it will be temporary as the interest rates will go down later). I really think moving is a huge decision and you should consider all other options first. It will take a lot of money to sell your home, buy another one, hire movers, etc. you‚Äôll end up spending 10k on all this maybe.

@tracyramsumair7257,"Hey Pooja, I'm actually from the Caribbean (the tropics) and I migrated last year with my husband. We did research and realise ontario was too expensive so we came to Calgary. I was just as skeptical as you in terms of weather and things to do., but boy was I wrong! Calgary is beautiful and clean and way cheaper! There are tons to do! The weather gets pretty intense sometimes but it doesn't last long and the chinooks help alot! Also, Calgary is the sunniest city in Canada so you would love that! We are surrounded by mountains and nature! Banff is not far away as well. Trust me, you won't regret it. It is cheaper here and you get bigger and more beautiful houses here for half the price you paid in Toronto. You could at least visit first and explore and then decide if it's for you! Ps. Love your videos so much! I've been watching them since I lived in Trinidad üáπüáπ years ago!",2023-05-27T16:27:34Z,POSITIVE

@Jasmeetpable,"Hey Pooja
I‚Äôm 21 years old living in Toronto. Did my bachelors here and working in a top 5 banks with good amount of pay. Now recently my parents had visited me and they are young (in their 40s), they HATED Canada and would not like to settle here. They are forcing me to come back as we live in Mumbai (we have our own big houses, well settled business and cars and what not!) I have decided to earn here for quite some time take all the money ( which I have spend here on education and buy a apartment in India) and settle there. Rather than working here pay cheque to pay cheque why not work hard there (keeping in mind that if recession ever hit hard, in Toronto I will be lay off and then most probably I will not be able to pay my rent and expenses) where as I‚Äôin India atleast my dad is there to support me. 

In 3.5years I have realized that INDIA IS THE BEST COUNTRY. Canada is just the hype and working your ass off here, where government will never want you to be rich here.  Rental price is sky rocketing, food price is going up. In India atleast you can afford to eat despite earning very less, not possible in Canada.",2023-05-27T16:10:10Z,NEUTRAL

Also PLEASE get a side job peekapoo you‚Äôre young and should push yourself as much as possible.

Because right now its just you 2 then soon you 4(2 children) there expenses are extreme plus you would need help and support as you can do house hold basic things yourself you can not even cook 2 meals for yourself you order Tiffen or it‚Äôs sponsored. Kids can not have that. You like every branded and expensive normal thing cab do the same job but still anyways your choice. I don‚Äôt think you can survive here to be honest.

It is wise to move to Calgary. My husband and I, we moved to Calgary from Toronto and we have loved every moment of it. It is not too crowded and Calgary is surrounded by beautiful mountains and lakes, where we spend our time during weekends in summer. And it‚Äôs a myth that weather conditions here are harsh. It is no at all windy like Toronto. Since Calgary is surrounded by mountains, we receive warm winds here in winter due to which the temperature goes to positive degrees in winters!! We also recently bought a house on the hills in Calgary. It is worth it!! The house buying process was very smooth. Let us know if you need more information. Thanks.",2023-05-27T15:54:08Z,POSITIVE
